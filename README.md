<h1>Dynamic Website</h1>
<p>This is the third project in the series of <strong>The Creativ JS Course</strong> by Deved</p>
</br>
<p>In this case I created a dynamic website using <strong>ScrollMagic</strong> and <strong>GSAP</strong> for animations, and <strong>barba.js</strong> for transitions </p>
<p>Again, Tailwind CSS mainly in the CSS plus some custom styles</p>
<p>Hoe you enjoy!</p>
